lines.txt:
- A line is defined by two points
- Each point is separated by a comma

// C data structure for representing a point
typedef struct {
  double x;
  double y;
} point_t;      // can now declare a point type variable like so:  point_t p;

// C data structure for representing a line
typedef struct {
  point_t p0;
  point_t p1;
} line_t;       // can now declare a line type variable like so:   line_t l;

We need to allocate dynamic memory for the line array of size TOTAL_LINES
- TOTAL_LINES = 10

line_t* line_array = (lint_t*)malloc(TOTAL_LINES * sizeof(line_t));
